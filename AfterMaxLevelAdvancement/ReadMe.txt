[h1][b]OVERVIEW[/b][/h1]
Now your Colonels have a chance (configurable) to get extra ability points after every successfull mission. Same value of APs as during promotion, depends on combat intelligence.

[h1][b]COMPATIBILITY[/b][/h1]
This mod should be compatible with almost everything 
and you should be able to add/remove it mid campaign without any problem.
No class override.
